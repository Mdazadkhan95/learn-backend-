// require vs import

// example import {sum} from "./math.js"


// we can't selective load only the pices we need with require but with import, we can selective load only the piece we need which can save memory.


//  loading is synchronous for require but can be asynchronous for "import".

// if you want to use a import method so firstly make a package .json file and write there 

// "type": "module"
